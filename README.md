I finished this project using some existing code provided to develop a work day scheduler so as to provide an employee with the opportuniy to plan the day and to help make them more productive. The planner allows for the user to add mutiple task for each hour of the work day; the scheduler uses work hours from 9 to 5. At the start of the work day at 9 am the block will be red and upcoming hours will be green. As the hours progress the red block hour will indicate the working hour or active hour of the day. Past hours will start showing with a gray background and upcoming hours will continue to show up as green. When the user inputs there information into an hour block they have the option to save and store the information and it will be stored with the abilty to open in another tab or be refreshed without losing there information. Lastly they can change the existing information they have saved and edit it and save the new changes.

We used bootstrap and font awesome to help us with styles on this and moment for the date, time, clock aspects.
